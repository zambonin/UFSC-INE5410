This is a k-means clustering algorithm implementation with some sort of
parallelism implemented using POSIX threads. It was thoroughly tested, but you
can never trust Bash scripts enough.

It is around ten times faster than its sequential counterpart with four threads
on an Intel Core i3-2100 @ 3.1 GHz.

There's also a MPI implementation, but due to bad logic and/or rounding errors,
it probably shouldn't be trusted either.
